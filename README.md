# Photo Notes

### What is it?

Photo Notes is a tool meant to help students take notes in the online environment, but can also be used for convenience.  When taking notes, it often helps to have the professors images and diagrams nested inside of your notes.  When using markdown, this can be inconvenient to do in class.  Using photoNotes, you can take a screenshot of your lecture as its playing and move it to whichever images directory you'd like to use for your class.  PhotoNotes also creates a markdown insertion link so that you can view the image within your notes.

### How does it work?

The tool works by monitoring new input in whatever directory your screenshots are automatically sent to.  When a new file is added to that directory when the program is running, it moves that file to whichever folder the user specifies at start time.
